# Encrypt1
This repository provides an encryption tool to secure your files. Even if someone gains access, they won't be able to read them without the decryption key. 

This encrypting method works by having two public and two private keys - both in the form of a string and a prime number. The user can choose the string and the prime that he wants public. The reason the encryption is secure is the existence of the private keys, which act like passwords. The user remembers them and inputs them on being asked. Thus, each encrypted message/file can have a separate prime and/or string.
